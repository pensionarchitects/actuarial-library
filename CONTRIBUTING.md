## How to contribute to the actuarial library

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the library**, and instead try to [contact](http://www.pensionarchitects.be/en/) us.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/pensionarchitects/actuarial-library/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/pensionarchitects/actuarial-library/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug, add a new feature or changed an existing one?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the actuarial library and will generally not be accepted.

The actuarial library is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to join and contribute!
